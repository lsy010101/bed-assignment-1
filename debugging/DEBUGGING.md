# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Main event

-   **Breakpoint Location:** portfolioperformance.ts file line 9 onwards
-   **Objective:** Create multiple summary criterias without using if

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [List key variables and their values]
-   **Call Stack:** [Summarize the function sequence leading to the breakpoint]
-   **Behavior:** [Describe what happens at this point in the program]

### Analysis

-   That JavaScript and TypeScript are much more similar than I expected.
-   Everything went smoothly on this part.
-   Aside from some code optimizations I think I did pretty OK on this part atleast.
-   I learned that it's kind of like JavaScript but you just need to specify a lot more stuff like type annotations.

## Scenario 2: Issue in the Pull Request

-   **Breakpoint Location:** portfolioPerformance.test.ts file line 14 etc.
-   **Objective:** Testing the portfolioperformance.ts method/function

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [List key variables and their values]
-   **Call Stack:** [Summarize the function sequence leading to the breakpoint]
-   **Behavior:** [Describe what happens at this point in the program]

### Analysis

-   It's working in my local machine but it didn't really catch that I forgot to put a type annotation on the mockData constant
-   Im pretty sure I know what to do or I have the correct idea but I can't execute it due to time.
-   I need better time management.
-   Im pretty sure I just need to import the portfolio performance and assign that to mockdata as its type.

## No screenshot 3 due to not doing the other 2 functions in step 7 ;-;

-   Also, I'm not really familiar with the debugger tool since we didn't really use it last term. We used it like once or twice I think.
